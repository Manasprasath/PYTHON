1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions.

Example:

x = 10

if x > 10:
    print("Greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("Equal to 10")
else:
    print("Less than 10")
Output:
Equal to 10

2. Loops (for, while)
Loops help in repeating a block of code multiple times.

for Loop Example:

for i in range(5):  # Loops from 0 to 4
    print(i)
Output:

0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
while Loop Example:

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
Output:


0  
1  
2  
3  
4  
3. Break and Continue
break exits the loop completely.
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
Example (break and continue in a for loop):
python

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break  # Stops the loop when i is 3
    print(i)
Output:


0  
1  
2  

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skips when i is 3
    print(i)
Output:

4. 

Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop.

Example:
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(2):  # Inner loop
        print(f"i = {i}, j = {j}")
Output:

ini
Copy
Edit
i = 0, j = 0  
i = 0, j = 1  
i = 1, j = 0  
i = 1, j = 1  
i = 2, j = 0  
i = 2, j = 1  Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop.

Example:

for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(2):  # Inner loop
        print(f"i = {i}, j = {j}")
Output:

i = 0, j = 0  
i = 0, j = 1  
i = 1, j = 0  
i = 1, j = 1  
i = 2, j = 0  
i = 2, j = 1
